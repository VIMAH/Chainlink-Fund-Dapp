# Chainlink-Fund-Dapp
To implement a decentralized fundraising application where contributors can send ETH, and the owner can later withdraw the funds. The contract utilizes Chainlink oracles to track the price of ETH in USD and requires a minimum contribution in USD.

This project uses a smart contract written in Solidity, the code is placed in the 'token.sol' file. However, you will have to paste it into https://remix.ethereum.org/ to ensure that the written code is executed in the smart contract.
